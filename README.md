# DRIFT

We introduce DRIFT, a novel data-driven framework for radio frequency (RF) tomography. The DRIFT framework comprises a cross-model sensing with RF and visual sensors, and incorporates a deep neural network (DNN) for RF sensing trained using a cross-model learning approach. In addition, the framework integrates an environmental change detector and a one-shot fine-tuning module to enable robust tomographic imaging of underground tubers in dynamic environments.

For data acquisition, we design a testbed named VR-Spin, a cross-modal sensing system equipped with RF and visual sensors. Containers of different sizes are used to hold the soil and tubers and can be easily replaced, thereby accelerating the data collection process.
