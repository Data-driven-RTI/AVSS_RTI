# AVSS_RTI

We introduce DRIFT, a novel data-driven framework for radio frequency (RF) tomography. The DRIFT framework comprises a cross-model sensing with RF and visual sensors, and incorporates a deep neural network (DNN) for RF sensing trained using a cross-model learning approach. In addition, the framework integrates an environmental change detector and a one-shot fine-tuning module to enable robust tomographic imaging of underground tubers in dynamic environments.
